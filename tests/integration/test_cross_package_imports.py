"""Runtime cross-package import gate.

This test imports every cross-package module that 'scitex-etc' references
in its source tree. Two outcomes:

- Module installed AND import succeeds → test PASSES.
- Module installed BUT import fails (e.g. an internal rename) →
  test FAILS loudly.
- Module NOT installed (peer standalone absent in the CI env) →
  test is SKIPPED via `pytest.importorskip`. The umbrella's CI
  (which installs every peer) catches cross-package renames.

scitex-etc references ``scitex_dev`` only from
``scitex_etc.media.render.mcp_server`` (a ``[dev]`` extra used to locate the
optional ``fastmcp`` dependency); the import is guarded, so a minimal runtime
install without scitex_dev still imports the module cleanly.
